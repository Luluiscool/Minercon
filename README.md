# MINERCON 1.2

## Minecron is one of my weird, exotic or whatever the hell it is.
## Just dont install this it is too cringe
## WHY I EVEN MADE THIS?
## I guess atleast i made my rendering engine from scratch for this game and it turned out pretty well...
## But later i thought it needs some bug fixes and more features...
## So i Published another version of it...
## This keeped happening like so much and at the end i published **more than 10** Versions of it.
## But i later deleted a few because those updates were **critical**
## So the website i made for the rendering engine is [Here](http://poxer.netlify.app)
## And **YES** so far i didn't called the engine with its name because *IDK*
